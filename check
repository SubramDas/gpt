CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.5 has been removed from CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value.  Or, use the <min>...<max> syntax
  to tell CMake that the project requires at least <min> but has been updated
  to work with policies introduced by <max> or earlier.

  Or, add -DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5 to try configuring anyway.

CMake Warning at logger/CMakeLists.txt:6 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindDlt.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Dlt", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Dlt" with any of
  the following names:

    DltConfig.cmake
    dlt-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Dlt" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "Dlt_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Dlt" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
